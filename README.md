# MachineLearning

## ML Use Case 1
##### Linear Regression for degrees 1, 3, 6, and 9.



## ML Use Case 2
##### K nearest neighabour 
-KNN classifier is used for cancer detection using Breast Cancer wisconsin dataset. It give fewer incorrect predictions and hence higher accuracy score.


#### Techniques that could be implemented in Future
There are more advanced techniques that could have been implemented here. For example, I could have used on a dataset containing information on various cellular parameters to differentiate malignant cells from benign ones.
