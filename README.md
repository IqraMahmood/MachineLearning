# MachineLearning

## ML Use Case 1
##### Linear Regression for degrees 1, 3, 6, and 9.



## ML Use Case 2
##### K nearest neighabour 
-KNN classifier is used for cancer detection using Breast Cancer wisconsin dataset. It give fewer incorrect predictions and hence higher accuracy score.


#### Techniques that could be implemented in Future
There are more advanced techniques that could have been implemented here. For example, I could have used on a dataset containing information on various cellular parameters to differentiate malignant cells from benign ones.



## ML Use Case 3
##### Segmentation Using K-Means
The project uses unsupervised technique to apply K-mean algorithm to a data of mall customers.
K-means algorithm classify the customer into 5 cluster that describe their behavior according to income and age.


**Thee are the simple machine learning projects. I hope to work on more complicated projects in the near future**
